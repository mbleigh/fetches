== Fetches ==

Fetches is a simple extension to ActionController that allows you to DRY up your
model fetching with a simple, intuitive syntax. Rather than creating helpers or
manually finding records each time an action is processed, simply add a call to
'fetches' in your controller and it will take care of the rest.

== Example ==

  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    fetches :user
    
    def show
      user # equivalent to a memoizing call to User.find(params[:id])
    end
  end
  
It's very simple, and can also be extended to meet more complex demands, such as:
  
  # routes as a nested /users/:user_id/articles
  class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
    fetches :user, :as => :author, :from => :user_id, :using => find_by_login
    fetches :article
    
    def index
      author # equivalent to User.find_by_login(params[:user_id])
    end
  end

The helper method generated memoizes (initializes once then doesn't make additional
calls to the database) and is available both in the controller and the view.
